## 11/6/2025 - Learned and did a circuit diagram.  

I watched, read and made a circuit diagram in kicad 9.0

I watched many videos and learned about how keyboards work, how they are made. And learned about the matrix structure, and what are the uses of diode.

Splitix MK1 is a split keyboard (like Ironman's one) so today I did circuit diagram of matrix and connected it.

I learned about the MCUs, but not sure, which one to use.

## 11/9/2025 - Selected controller, gathered all components  

This journal is for yesterday and today's drawing

I learned about controller for Splitix, by asking in slack and learning in youtube. and selected the controller.

But after selecting the controller, it was not there in kicad so i searched for long time and atlast i got the right circuit and foot print for pro micro.

And learned about neopixels ( it's led but it has it's own brain ) and added encoder, display.

And I drew the keyboard by hand in paper to fix the keys, I didn't connect the circuit yet, I will do it in evening.
