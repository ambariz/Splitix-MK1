## 11/6/2025 - Learned and did a circuit diagram.  

I watched, read and made a circuit diagram in kicad 9.0

I watched many videos and learned about how keyboards work, how they are made. And learned about the matrix structure, and what are the uses of diode.

Splitix MK1 is a split keyboard (like Ironman's one) so today I did circuit diagram of matrix and connected it.

I learned about the MCUs, but not sure, which one to use.
