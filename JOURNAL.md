## 11/6/2025 - Learned and did a circuit diagram.  

I watched, read and made a circuit diagram in kicad 9.0

I watched many videos and learned about how keyboards work, how they are made. And learned about the matrix structure, and what are the uses of diode.

Splitix MK1 is a split keyboard (like Ironman's one) so today I did circuit diagram of matrix and connected it.

I learned about the MCUs, but not sure, which one to use.

## 11/9/2025 12 PM - Selected controller, gathered all components  

This journal is for yesterday and today's drawing

I learned about controller for Splitix, by asking in slack and learning in youtube. and selected the controller.

But after selecting the controller, it was not there in kicad so i searched for long time and atlast i got the right circuit and foot print for pro micro.

And learned about neopixels ( it's led but it has it's own brain ) and added encoder, display.

And I drew the keyboard by hand in paper to fix the keys, I didn't connect the circuit yet, I will do it in evening.

## 11/9/2025 11 PM - Connected everything, now circuit is complete  

Today I connected all the components.

I learned that not every component can be connected in any pin, every pin has it's own work.

I added capacitor for each and every pixel and two capacitors. And two capacitors in starting of the neopixel for more filter.

capacitors are like filter for tea

Connecting everything is very hard, It was confusing but i used different colours for it, 

like red for vcc, blue for gnd, green for others

I think now the circuit is completed.  

## 11/10/2025 - Added Battery, Changed few pins on circuit  

I learned how to add battery to this circuit, and how to check battery percentage using voltage divider.

There is a formula for voltage divider.

using that formula we can calculate the remaining battery. 

First I connected the voltage divider in normal pin but after learning a bit more, it should in a pin with a work called ADC which means analog to digital converter.

And I put X in unused pins, because kicad thinks it's a problem.

I can't say the circuit is over, yesterday I thought the circuit was over but today I made changes.

This is current circuit. (without matrix and leds) ( and I changed the Kicad theme too )
